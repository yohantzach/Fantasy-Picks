# Deadline Enforcement System

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The deadline enforcement system has been comprehensively implemented to ensure that **no user can create or edit teams after the deadline**, which is set to **2 hours before the first match of each gameweek**. Admin users are exempt from these restrictions for management purposes.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Accurate Deadline Calculation**
- **Deadline Formula**: 2 hours before the first match kickoff time
- **Source**: Official FPL API fixture data
- **Real-time Updates**: Deadlines are automatically calculated and updated
- **Timezone Support**: All times handled in UTC with proper conversions

### 2. **Multi-Layer Enforcement**
- **Middleware Layer**: Global `checkDeadlineMiddleware` applied to all routes
- **Route-Level Checks**: Individual deadline validation in critical endpoints
- **Admin Bypass**: Admins can always create/edit teams for testing purposes

### 3. **Comprehensive Route Protection**

#### 🚫 **BLOCKED Routes** (after deadline for non-admins):
- `POST /api/team/save` - Team creation/editing
- `POST /api/team` - Legacy team creation
- `POST /api/team/complete-registration` - Team registration completion
- `PUT /api/team/:id` - Team updates
- `PATCH /api/team/:id` - Team modifications

#### ✅ **ALLOWED Routes** (always accessible):
- `GET /api/team/current` - View current team
- `GET /api/teams/user` - View user's teams
- `GET /api/leaderboard/:gameweekId` - View leaderboards
- `GET /api/gameweek/current` - View gameweek info
- `GET /api/fpl/players` - View player data
- `GET /api/fpl/fixtures` - View fixtures

## 🛡️ Implementation Details

### Middleware: `checkDeadlineMiddleware`

```typescript
// Applied globally to all routes
app.use(checkDeadlineMiddleware);

// Features:
- ✅ Checks current gameweek deadline status
- ✅ Admin bypass for fantasypicks09@gmail.com
- ✅ Detailed logging of blocked attempts
- ✅ Comprehensive error responses with deadline info
- ✅ Automatic detection of team modification routes
```

### Route-Level Enforcement

Each critical endpoint includes explicit deadline checks:

```typescript
// Example from /api/team/save
const now = new Date();
const deadline = new Date(currentGameweek.deadline);
const isDeadlinePassed = now > deadline;

if (!req.user!.isAdmin && (isDeadlinePassed || isGameweekCompleted)) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: "Deadline has passed - team creation/editing is now closed",
    deadline: deadline.toISOString(),
    currentTime: now.toISOString(),
    // ... additional metadata
  });
}
```

## 📊 User Experience

### Regular Users
- **Before Deadline**: ✅ Can create/edit teams normally
- **After Deadline**: ❌ Team modifications blocked with clear error messages
- **Always Available**: View teams, leaderboards, player data

### Admin Users
- **Always**: ✅ Full access to all functionality
- **Logging**: All admin actions after deadline are logged
- **Purpose**: Testing, emergency fixes, late team adjustments

## 🔍 Error Responses

When deadline is passed, users receive detailed error information:

```json
{
  "error": "Deadline has passed - team creation/editing is now closed",
  "deadline": "2025-08-16T07:30:00.000Z",
  "currentTime": "2025-08-16T08:15:00.000Z",
  "gameweekNumber": 21,
  "isDeadlinePassed": true,
  "isGameweekCompleted": false,
  "hoursAfterDeadline": 0.75,
  "message": "You can still view the leaderboard to see results once matches are completed"
}
```

## 🚀 Admin Controls

### Deadline Management
- **Update Deadlines**: `POST /api/admin/update-deadlines`
- **Manual Score Calculation**: `POST /api/admin/calculate-scores/:gameweekId?`
- **Complete Gameweek**: `POST /api/admin/gameweek/:gameweekId/complete`

### Emergency Access
- Admins can create/edit teams at any time
- All admin actions after deadline are logged for audit
- No impact on regular user restrictions

## 📝 Logging & Monitoring

### Blocked Attempts
```
DEADLINE BLOCKED: User user@example.com tried to access POST /api/team/save
Deadline: 2025-08-16T07:30:00.000Z, Current time: 2025-08-16T08:15:00.000Z
```

### Admin Overrides
```
ADMIN OVERRIDE: fantasypicks09@gmail.com saving team after deadline - allowed for admin
```

### Status Updates
```
Deadline check: 2.5 hours remaining until deadline
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test Coverage
- ✅ Deadline calculation accuracy
- ✅ Middleware blocking logic  
- ✅ Admin bypass functionality
- ✅ Route-specific enforcement
- ✅ Error response formatting

### Manual Testing
- Run `node server/test-deadline-simple.js` for quick validation
- Full integration tests available in `server/test-deadline-enforcement.ts`

## 🎯 Summary

The deadline enforcement system provides **bulletproof protection** against late team submissions while maintaining:

- **Accuracy**: Deadline calculated exactly 2 hours before first match
- **Reliability**: Multiple layers of validation prevent bypasses
- **Flexibility**: Admin access for management needs
- **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages and status information
- **Auditable**: Comprehensive logging of all actions
- **Maintainable**: Clean, well-documented implementation

**Result**: ✅ **No user can create or edit teams after deadline** (except admins for management purposes)
